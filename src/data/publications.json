        "abstract": "Africa hosts the greatest human genetic diversity globally, but\nlegacies of ancient population interactions and dispersals\nacross the continent remain understudied. Here, we report\ngenome-wide data from 20 ancient sub-Saharan African\nindividuals, including the first reported ancient DNA from the\nDRC, Uganda, and Botswana. These data demonstrate the\ncontraction of diverse, once contiguous hunter-gatherer\npopulations, and suggest the resistance to interaction with\nincoming pastoralists of delayed-return foragers in aquatic\nenvironments. We refine models for the spread of food producers\ninto eastern and southern Africa, demonstrating more complex\ntrajectories of admixture than previously suggested. In\nBotswana, we show that Bantu ancestry post-dates admixture\nbetween pastoralists and foragers, suggesting an earlier spread\nof pastoralism than farming to southern Africa. Our findings\ndemonstrate how processes of migration and admixture have\nmarkedly reshaped the genetic map of sub-Saharan Africa in the\npast few millennia and highlight the utility of combined\narchaeological and archaeogenetic approaches.",

Similar to previously\ndescribed genetic changes in other parts of Europe from the\nearly 3rd millennium BCE, we detect an arrival of ancestry\nrelated to Late Neolithic pastoralists from the Pontic-Caspian\nsteppe in Switzerland as early as 2860\u20132460 calBCE.

This pattern, reaching at\nleast as far back as the appearance of our species in the\npaleontological record, has left its traces in our genomes.\nReconstructing a population's history from these traces is a\nchallenging problem. Here we present a novel approach based on\nthe Multiple Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (MSMC) to analyze\nthe separation history between populations. Our approach, called\nMSMC-IM, uses an improved implementation of the MSMC (MSMC2) to\nestimate coalescence rates within and across pairs of\npopulations, and then fits a continuous Isolation-Migration model\nto these rates to obtain a time-dependent estimate of gene flow.\nWe show, using simulations, that our method can identify complex\ndemographic scenarios involving post-split admixture or archaic\nintrogression. We apply MSMC-IM to whole genome sequences from 15\nworldwide populations, tracking the process of human genetic\ndiversification. We detect traces of extremely deep ancestry\nbetween some African populations, with around 1\\% of ancestry\ndating to divergences older than a million years ago.",

During the Last Glacial Maximum\n(LGM), the peninsula formed a periglacial refugium [1] for\nhunter-gatherers (HGs) and thus served as a potential source for\nthe re-peopling of northern latitudes [2]. The post-LGM genetic\nsignature was previously described as a cline from Western HG\n(WHG) to Eastern HG (EHG), further shaped by later Holocene\nexpansions from the Near East and the North Pontic steppes [3-9].\nWestern and central Europe were dominated by ancestry associated\nwith the \u223c14,000-year-old individual from Villabruna, Italy,\nwhich had largely replaced earlier genetic ancestry, represented\nby 19,000-15,000-year-old individuals associated with the\nMagdalenian culture [2]. However, little is known about the\ngenetic diversity in southern European refugia, the presence of\ndistinct genetic clusters, and correspondence with geography.\nHere, we report new genome-wide data from 11 HGs and Neolithic\nindividuals that highlight the late survival of Paleolithic\nancestry in Iberia, reported previously in Magdalenian-associated\nindividuals. We show that all Iberian HGs, including the oldest,\na \u223c19,000-year-old individual from El Mir\u00f3n in Spain, carry dual\nancestry from both Villabruna and the Magdalenian-related\nindividuals. Thus, our results suggest an early connection\nbetween two potential refugia, resulting in a genetic ancestry\nthat survived in later Iberian HGs. Our new genomic data from\nIberian Early and Middle Neolithic individuals show that the dual\nIberian HG genomic legacy pertains in the peninsula, suggesting\nthat expanding farmers mixed with local HGs.

The genetic relationship\nbetween Palaeo-Eskimos and Native American, Inuit, Yup'ik and\nAleut populations remains uncertain4-6. Here we present genomic\ndata for 48 ancient individuals from Chukotka, East Siberia, the\nAleutian Islands, Alaska, and the Canadian Arctic. We co-analyse\nthese data with data from present-day Alaskan I\u00f1upiat and West\nSiberian populations and published genomes. Using methods based\non rare-allele and haplotype sharing, as well as established\ntechniques4,7-9, we show that Palaeo-Eskimo-related ancestry is\nubiquitous among people who speak Na-Dene and Eskimo-Aleut\nlanguages. We develop a comprehensive model for the Holocene\npeopling events of Chukotka and North America, and show that\nNa-Dene-speaking peoples, people of the Aleutian Islands, and\nYup'ik and Inuit across the Arctic region all share ancestry from\na single Palaeo-Eskimo-related Siberian source.",

        "abstract": "The indigenous populations of inner Eurasia-a huge geographic\nregion covering the central Eurasian steppe and the northern\nEurasian taiga and tundra-harbour tremendous diversity in their\ngenes, cultures and languages. In this study, we report novel\ngenome-wide data for 763 individuals from Armenia, Georgia,\nKazakhstan, Moldova, Mongolia, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine and\nUzbekistan. We furthermore report additional damage-reduced\ngenome-wide data of two previously published individuals from the\nEneolithic Botai culture in Kazakhstan (~5,400 BP). We find that\npresent-day inner Eurasian populations are structured into three\ndistinct admixture clines stretching between various western and\neastern Eurasian ancestries, mirroring geography. The Botai and\nmore recent ancient genomes from Siberia show a decrease in\ncontributions from so-called 'ancient North Eurasian' ancestry\nover time, which is detectable only in the northern-most\n'forest-tundra' cline. The intermediate 'steppe-forest' cline\ndescends from the Late Bronze Age steppe ancestries, while the\n'southern steppe' cline further to the south shows a strong\nWest/South Asian influence. Ancient genomes suggest a northward\nspread of the southern steppe cline in Central Asia during the\nfirst millennium BC. Finally, the genetic structure of Caucasus\npopulations highlights a role of the Caucasus Mountains as a\nbarrier to gene flow and suggests a post-Neolithic gene flow into\nNorth Caucasus populations from the steppe.",

        "abstract": "British population history has been shaped by a series of\nimmigration periods, including the Roman occupation from AD 43\nand Early Anglo-Saxon migrations after AD 410. Until recently,\nit was an open question to whatthe extent to which these events\nchanged the genetic population structure in Britain was an open\nquestion. Two recent genetic studies have provided new insights\ninto this question, by analysing the genome sequences from 19\nancient British samples in total, dating from between the 1st\ncentury BC until and the 8th century AD . Here we will review\nthese two recent studies, present a joint analysis of all 19\navailable samples, and will put the results into a wider\narchaeological context. Key results reviewed here include: 1\nHigh high levels of genetic continuity between the late Late\nIron Age and the Romano-British period; 2 a clear increase in\nancestry related to the modern Dutch population during the\nAnglo-Saxon period, suggesting a substantial arrival of new\npeople during this time; 3 an estimated 38 \\% average of the\nproportion of Anglo-Saxon ancestry in the modern English\npopulation at 38\\% on average; 4 evidence from an Early\nAnglo-Saxon cemetery near Cambridge for of early admixture\nbetween of Anglo-Saxon immigrants and indigenous British\ninhabitants from an early Anglo-Saxon cemetery near Cambridge.",

Here we present 90\nmitochondrial genomes as well as genome-wide data sets from three\nindividuals obtained from Egyptian mummies. The samples recovered\nfrom Middle Egypt span around 1,300 years of ancient Egyptian\nhistory from the New Kingdom to the Roman Period.

The multiple sequentially Markovian coalescent\n(MSMC) analyzes the observed pattern of mutations in multiple\nindividuals, focusing on the first coalescence between any two\nindividuals. Results from applying MSMC to genome sequences from\nnine populations across the world suggest that the genetic\nseparation of non-African ancestors from African Yoruban\nancestors started long before 50,000 years ago and give\ninformation about human population history as recent as 2,000\nyears ago, including the bottleneck in the peopling of the\nAmericas and separations within Africa, East Asia and Europe.",

Their evolution builds on\ngenome evolution in a complicated way, which involves selection,\ngenetic drift, mutations and recombination. Here we develop a\ncoarse-grained evolutionary statistics for phenotypes, which\ndecouples from details of the underlying genotypes. We derive\napproximate evolution equations for the distribution of\nphenotype values within and across populations. This dynamics\ncovers evolutionary processes at high and low recombination\nrates, that is, it applies to sexual and asexual populations. In\na fitness landscape with a single optimal phenotype value, the\nphenotypic diversity within populations and the divergence\nbetween populations reach evolutionary equilibria, which\ndescribe stabilizing selection. We compute the equilibrium\ndistributions of both quantities analytically and we show that\nthe ratio of mean divergence and diversity depends on the\nstrength of selection in a universal way: it is largely\nindependent of the phenotype's genomic encoding and of the\nrecombination rate. This establishes a new method for the\ninference of selection on molecular phenotypes beyond the genome\nlevel. We discuss the implications of our findings for the\npredictability of evolutionary processes.",

        "abstract": "The predominantly African origin of all modern human populations\nis well established, but the route taken out of Africa is still\nunclear. Two alternative routes, via Egypt and Sinai or across\nthe Bab el Mandeb strait into Arabia, have traditionally been\nproposed as feasible gateways in light of geographic,\npaleoclimatic, archaeological, and genetic evidence.\nDistinguishing among these alternatives has been difficult. We\ngenerated 225 whole-genome sequences (225 at 8\u00d7 depth, of which\n8 were increased to 30\u00d7; Illumina HiSeq 2000) from six modern\nNortheast African populations (100 Egyptians and five Ethiopian\npopulations each represented by 25 individuals). West Eurasian\ncomponents were masked out, and the remaining African haplotypes\nwere compared with a panel of sub-Saharan African and\nnon-African genomes. We showed that masked Northeast African\nhaplotypes overall were more similar to non-African haplotypes\nand more frequently present outside Africa than were any sets of\nhaplotypes derived from a West African population. Furthermore,\nthe masked Egyptian haplotypes showed these properties more\nmarkedly than the masked Ethiopian haplotypes, pointing to Egypt\nas the more likely gateway in the exodus to the rest of the\nworld. Using five Ethiopian and three Egyptian high-coverage\nmasked genomes and the multiple sequentially Markovian\ncoalescent (MSMC) approach, we estimated the genetic split times\nof Egyptians and Ethiopians from non-African populations at\n55,000 and 65,000 years ago, respectively, whereas that of West\nAfricans was estimated to be 75,000 years ago. Both the\nhaplotype and MSMC analyses thus suggest a predominant northern\nroute out of Africa via Egypt.",

Whereas there is no evidence of the\nearliest modern humans in Europe contributing to the genetic\ncomposition of present-day Europeans, all individuals between\n~37,000 and ~14,000 years ago descended from a single founder\npopulation which forms part of the ancestry of present-day\nEuropeans. An ~35,000-year-old individual from northwest Europe\nrepresents an early branch of this founder population which was\nthen displaced across a broad region, before reappearing in\nsouthwest Europe at the height of the last Ice Age ~19,000 years\nago. During the major warming period after ~14,000 years ago, a\ngenetic component related to present-day Near Easterners became\nwidespread in Europe.

This fact\ncan be used to map quantitative trait loci by sequencing the\npooled DNA from the population at consecutive time points, and\nobserving allele frequency changes. Here we present a population\ngenetic method to analyse time-series data of allele frequencies\nfrom such an experiment. Beginning with a range of proposed\nevolutionary scenarios, the method measures the consistency of\neach with the observed frequency changes. Evolutionary theory is\nutilized to formulate equations of motion for the allele\nfrequencies, following which likelihoods for having observed the\nsequencing data under each scenario are derived. Comparison of\nthese likelihoods gives an insight into the prevailing dynamics\nof the system under study. We illustrate the method by\nquantifying selective effects from an experiment in which two\nphenotypically different yeast strains were first crossed and\nthen propagated under heat stress (Parts et al., Genome Res.\n2011). From these data we discover that about 6\\% of polymorphic\nsites evolve non-neutrally under heat stress condition, either\nbecause of their linkage to beneficial (driver) alleles or\nbecause they are drivers themselves. We further identify 44\ngenomic regions containing one or more candidate driver alleles,\nquantify their apparent selective advantage, obtain estimates of\nrecombination rates within the regions, and show that the\ndynamics of the drivers display a strong signature of selection\ngoing beyond additive models. Our approach is applicable to study\nadaptation in a range of systems under different evolutionary\npressures.",

Linkage generates interference interactions,\nby which simultaneously occurring mutations affect each other's\nchance of fixation. Here, we develop a comprehensive model of\nadaptive evolution in linked genomes, which integrates\ninterference interactions between multiple beneficial and\ndeleterious mutations into a unified framework. By an approximate\nanalytical solution, we predict the fixation rates of these\nmutations, as well as the probabilities of beneficial and\ndeleterious alleles at fixed genomic sites. We find that\ninterference interactions generate a regime of emergent\nneutrality: all genomic sites with selection coefficients smaller\nin magnitude than a characteristic threshold have nearly random\nfixed alleles, and both beneficial and deleterious mutations at\nthese sites have nearly neutral fixation rates. We show that this\ndynamics limits not only the speed of adaptation, but also a\npopulation's degree of adaptation in its current environment. We\napply the model to different scenarios: stationary adaptation in\na time-dependent environment, and approach to equilibrium in a\nfixed environment. In both cases, the analytical predictions are\nin good agreement with numerical simulations. Our results suggest\nthat interference can severely compromise biological functions in\nan adapting population, which sets viability limits on adaptive\nevolution under linkage.",
