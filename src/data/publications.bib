              spread of the southern steppe cline in Central Asia during the

               information and organismic functions, fitness, and evolution.
               Complex phenotypes, which are also called quantitative traits,
               often depend on multiple genomic loci. Their evolution builds on
               genome evolution in a complicated way, which involves selection,
               genetic drift, mutations and recombination. Here we develop a
               coarse-grained evolutionary statistics for phenotypes, which
               decouples from details of the underlying genotypes. We derive
               approximate evolution equations for the distribution of
               phenotype values within and across populations. This dynamics
               covers evolutionary processes at high and low recombination
               rates, that is, it applies to sexual and asexual populations. In
               a fitness landscape with a single optimal phenotype value, the
               phenotypic diversity within populations and the divergence
               between populations reach evolutionary equilibria, which
               describe stabilizing selection. We compute the equilibrium
               distributions of both quantities analytically and we show that
               the ratio of mean divergence and diversity depends on the
               strength of selection in a universal way: it is largely
               independent of the phenotype's genomic encoding and of the
               recombination rate. This establishes a new method for the
               inference of selection on molecular phenotypes beyond the genome

               six modern Northeast African populations (100 Egyptians and five
               Ethiopian populations each represented by 25 individuals). West
               Eurasian components were masked out, and the remaining African
               haplotypes were compared with a panel of sub-Saharan African and
               non-African genomes. We showed that masked Northeast African
               haplotypes overall were more similar to non-African haplotypes
               and more frequently present outside Africa than were any sets of
               haplotypes derived from a West African population. Furthermore,
               the masked Egyptian haplotypes showed these properties more
               markedly than the masked Ethiopian haplotypes, pointing to Egypt
               as the more likely gateway in the exodus to the rest of the
               world. Using five Ethiopian and three Egyptian high-coverage
               masked genomes and the multiple sequentially Markovian
               coalescent (MSMC) approach, we estimated the genetic split times
               of Egyptians and Ethiopians from non-African populations at
               55,000 and 65,000 years ago, respectively, whereas that of West
               Africans was estimated to be 75,000 years ago. Both the
               haplotype and MSMC analyses thus suggest a predominant northern
               route out of Africa via Egypt.",

               51 Eurasians from ~45,000-7,000 years ago. Over this time, the
               proportion of Neanderthal DNA decreased from 3-6\% to around
               2\%, consistent with natural selection against Neanderthal
               variants in modern humans. Whereas there is no evidence of the
               earliest modern humans in Europe contributing to the genetic
               composition of present-day Europeans, all individuals between
               ~37,000 and ~14,000 years ago descended from a single founder
               population which forms part of the ancestry of present-day
               Europeans. An ~35,000-year-old individual from northwest Europe
               represents an early branch of this founder population which was

               English population derives 38\% of its ancestry from Anglo-Saxon
               migrations. We gain further insight with a new method, rarecoal,

  abstract = "When selection is acting on a large, genetically diverse
              population, beneficial alleles increase in frequency. This fact
              can be used to map quantitative trait loci by sequencing the
              pooled DNA from the population at consecutive time points, and
              observing allele frequency changes. Here we present a population
              genetic method to analyse time-series data of allele frequencies
              from such an experiment. Beginning with a range of proposed
              evolutionary scenarios, the method measures the consistency of
              each with the observed frequency changes. Evolutionary theory is
              utilized to formulate equations of motion for the allele
              frequencies, following which likelihoods for having observed the
              sequencing data under each scenario are derived. Comparison of
              these likelihoods gives an insight into the prevailing dynamics
              of the system under study. We illustrate the method by
              quantifying selective effects from an experiment in which two
              phenotypically different yeast strains were first crossed and
              then propagated under heat stress (Parts et al., Genome Res.
              2011). From these data we discover that about 6\% of polymorphic
              sites evolve non-neutrally under heat stress condition, either
              because of their linkage to beneficial (driver) alleles or
              because they are drivers themselves. We further identify 44
              genomic regions containing one or more candidate driver alleles,
              quantify their apparent selective advantage, obtain estimates of
              recombination rates within the regions, and show that the
              dynamics of the drivers display a strong signature of selection
              going beyond additive models. Our approach is applicable to study
              adaptation in a range of systems under different evolutionary

              evolutionary force. Linkage generates interference interactions,
              by which simultaneously occurring mutations affect each other's
              chance of fixation. Here, we develop a comprehensive model of
              adaptive evolution in linked genomes, which integrates
              interference interactions between multiple beneficial and
              deleterious mutations into a unified framework. By an approximate
              analytical solution, we predict the fixation rates of these
              mutations, as well as the probabilities of beneficial and
              deleterious alleles at fixed genomic sites. We find that
              interference interactions generate a regime of emergent
              neutrality: all genomic sites with selection coefficients smaller
              in magnitude than a characteristic threshold have nearly random
              fixed alleles, and both beneficial and deleterious mutations at
              these sites have nearly neutral fixation rates. We show that this
              dynamics limits not only the speed of adaptation, but also a
              population's degree of adaptation in its current environment. We
              apply the model to different scenarios: stationary adaptation in
              a time-dependent environment, and approach to equilibrium in a
              fixed environment. In both cases, the analytical predictions are
              in good agreement with numerical simulations. Our results suggest
              that interference can severely compromise biological functions in
              an adapting population, which sets viability limits on adaptive
              evolution under linkage.",
