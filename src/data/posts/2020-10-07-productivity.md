There is a lot of buzz in the internet about "Productivity". If you dive down the Google Rabbit hole, you'll find dozens of blog posts, reddit channels and tools about productivity. But what does "productivity" actually mean? I guess what people _want_ it to be is some sort of output per time ratio. So the way it's understood - I believe - is that a person with a "high productivity" achieves more in the same time than a person with "low productivity".

I think that this definition, and even the term itself, is not terribly meaningful. First, I believe you can't really quantify "productive work", and second, if you follow the people writing about this, it's actually more about psychology than productivity. I believe what people mean when they try to optimise their productivity, is that they seek methods and ways to _feel_ more productive, to _feel_ more in control over your life. And indeed, I think we _should_ try and optimise the way we manage our lives in order to get a sense of control. You actually _are_ more productive if you feel more in control over all the stuff that you have committed to, that trickles on you every day and that you need to deal with.

So the "productivity" best-practices summarised in this post are really more about creating a sense of control over your life, and in doing so, hopefully also may make you actually more productive.

Why is productivity even something that even comes up? A theory that I took from the book "Getting things done" by David Allen (somewhat the bible of productivity nerds) that most of us, in academia but also in most jobs outside of it, do what has been called "knowledge work". Knowledge workers define their own tasks. This is different from old-school industrial-age work, where you are told exactly what to do and you're supposed to execute that job faithfully every day. In contrast, most jobs in our age, including blue-collar jobs, have become more knowledge work. It is expected from us that we manage our work-life to a certain extent ourselves, that we identify problems to work on and figure out solutions for them. _Certainly_ this is the case in academia, where it's not only about investing your creativity to solve problems, but you're even supposed to come up with the problem in the first place. But even in more constrained jobs outside of academia, I'm sure you will recognise this pattern. If you think about what you actually _do_ every day, most jobs involve a substantial amount of admin/self-management/planning, however you want to call it, so work that isn't directly work, but perhaps more meta-work. It's work that you have to do in order to _define_ your actual work.

I would call myself an intermittent productivity-nerd. Every now and then I dive deep down, by books about it and try to "optimise" my "system", that is, Todo-lists, how to handle emails, project management, navigating work- vs. Private projects, etc. But whatever I tried out, I have always come back to a certain essential list of best practices that I'd like to share in this post.

Note that this is deliberately highly opinionated, you will read a lot of "don't" and "you should" kind of language. That's my freedom as blog author, as much as it's your freedom to ignore or reply with scathing criticism.

So, here are 7 of my all-time best practices I have discovered for me throughout the last dozen or so years:


# Inbox-Zero

This is one of the first things I fixed right away when I learned about it. It's easy to do and has a profound effect. I first learned about it when stumbling over a YouTube video of a talk at Google by Merlin Mann (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UjeTMb3Yk). When you google "Inbox Zero" you will find a _lot_!

Anyway, the idea is simple. Repeat after me: "An Inbox isn't an Archive". The idea of inboxes before emails was that of a finite tray where you could put stuff in that wasn't processed. Emphasis on _finite_ and _unprocessed_. Before email, nobody would even consider the idea of using your inbox as an archive. What a terrible idea, right? An inbox decidedly contains _unprocessed stuff_. Never has this become clearer than in the email-age. So, how do you empty your inbox? Well, you make decisions about the items in it. Each decision should result in three possible outcomes: Delete, Archive, Action.

Delete: This is the decision for items that you decide are not important to you. Period. The keyboard shortcut for deleting an email is the backspace key.

Archive: This decision applies if you feel the email may contain information that you'd want to come back to you later, or that is important for a project you're working on, even though there isn't an immediate action following from it. To archive an email, you simply need an email folder called "Archive", ideally living in the cloud so it's synchronised across your devices. I personally do _not_ sort archived emails into subfolders, because I found it's too much mental work and isn't worth it given modern search-methods that we have in our email clients, on Google-Mail, and so on. On my Mac Email Client, there is a convenient keyboard short cut to archive an email, and I use it _very_ often each day.

Action:  This decision applies to emails that require something to be done or managed by you. Only emails ending up as action item end up - in some way - in your todo-list. There are different ways to handle this. Some people have an "Action" email folder, where such emails go. When the action is complete, they move the email into the Archive. I personally prefer creating dedicated action items in my preferred Todo-Manager called [Things], with a link to the email (for which there are shortcuts). Some Todo-Tools, like Apple Reminders, support drag-and-drop of emails, which then creates a link to the email. Both of these methods allow immediate archival of such Todo-emails, because you have a link in your Todo-System. Example: You get an email from a colleague asking for comments on a paper. I then create a Todo (keyboard shortcut) titled "comment on Joe's paper" with a link to that email, and then immediately archive the email. That way, the action is clearly defined and resides in my Todo-System, and I don't need to see the email in my inbox anymore. More about details for this workflow below.

If you are new to "Inbox zero" you will likely have thousands of emails in your inbox at this point. Don't despair, you don't have to go through all of them. Just come up with a threshold, for example the beginning if this month, or beginning of this week, and move all emails before that time into a folder called "Archive before Oct 2020" or something like that. Then process the remaining emails the way I suggested above, and take it from here.

I try to empty my inbox several times a week. It has a profound effect of control when it's done. Every time.


# Capture everything

As David Allen says "Your brain is for having ideas, not keeping them". If I had to name a single best-practice that emerged from the Getting Things Done philosophy, it's constant capturing. How does it work? You need some kind of tool that allows you to quickly write down ideas or generally "stuff" that rains onto you. Examples:
- Someone comes into your office and asks you for slides of a talk you gave, you promised to send it to them -> Capture: "Send Joe slides"
- You are cooking in your kitchen and realise the soap is empty -> Capture "buy new soap"
- You realise when brining the kids to kindergarten that your car needs cleaning -> Capture "car needs cleaning"
- You are in a meeting and there are some decisions on next steps for which you volunteered -> Capture "Deal with X from Meeting"

Now, very importantly: Stuff that you've captured that way should _never_ end up unfiltered in your Todo-List. You need to process it, similarly to how you process your emails. Every day, ideally, you go through all the stuff in your capture-inbox, one-by-one and ask "What is this? Do I need to do something about this?". There are several ways that processing may end up: You may have identified a major new project, you may have a one-off Todo-item to be added to your Todo-list, you may have simply captured some information that you would like to keep for later reference, in which case it goes into some sort of archival system to be stored and findable, etc.

Making it a habit to capture everything the moment it comes to you, actually allows you to work _less_ distracted than it may sound at first. The problem with such "stuff that comes to you" is that it remains on your mind if you don't write it down or get it out. Whether you ignore it or not. It subconsciously creeps back to your conscience in unexpected moments, where it distracts you. If that happens a lot, it overwhelms you. Everyone experiences the immediate sense of calm if you write down a list, be it for packing for vacation, or your weekend-shopping. Simply writing items down puts you back in control. You can't forget that important thing that your colleague or friend just asked you to do, because you have immediately written it down, so it won't be forgotten, even you don't deal with it right away.

By the way, one immediate take away from this capture idea is that you should not even try and separate personal, private and work items. If you have something in your private life that's very important to you, things will typically creep up any time, including at work, so you'll want to have a way of capturing things in your private life just as much you capture work-related things, ideally into one system, actually! Similarly, you may get a good idea for one of your projects on Sunday afternoons at home with your family, so better to capture it right away and write it down, than keep thinking about it and ruining your afternoon with friends or the kids or so.


# Where's the next action?

Whether it's from email, or because you've captured something, or because you've received a letter, or someone slacked or messaged you about something: All of this should be considered a generalised Inbox, with _unprocessed_ stuff. Do not confuse this inbox with an archive (the email-fallacy) or a Todo-list. No, it's unprocessed. Before it ends up on your Todo-list, you need to ask yourself an absolutely essential question. For every item in your inbox (captured, email, letter, etc.) you need ask yourself "What is this" and "What is it that needs to be done about it". _Only_ if you have identified something that either you or someone else needs to do, will it end up in your Todo-List system. Everything else (reference material, garbage, etc.) should end up in the trash or in the archive. Simple as that.

So, how do you handle actual Action items, aka Todos? My personal preference is a dedicated tool for that, but I've also seen people using a pure email-based workflow as their "command center". In my case, I'm using [Things](..), but other options include Apple Reminders, Evernote, ToDoist or simple Text files. What's very important when managing actual To Dos is that they should always contain a real "Next Action". They should not contain entire projects (see below), or tasks that you've delegated, or tasks that you're not sure whether you want to do really do them. The usefulness of a ToDo-list really depends on whether you can literally look at it without much planning, pick an item and just do it. It's very easy for a ToDo-list to stress you out. What I have found is that you typically experience stress if you have items on your to do that you haven't thought about sufficiently.

Here are some bad examples for actual ToDos:
- Get rid of old Smartphones
- Work on your PhD thesis
- Mom birthday present

These are things that are blurry and obviously not thought through enough. For example, you can't "get rid" of your old smartphones, because you can't simply put them into the main trash. Also, "work on your PhD thesis" is a way too broad task. And "Mom birthday present" isn't a task at all. The problem with this is that you'll typically end up having dozens of ToDos (I currently have more than 60), and it's absolute key that you curate that list so that it does _not_ cause stress. But "work on your PhD thesis" is _very_ likely to cause stress because it's a daunting and big tasks. 

Here is how you can improve on it:
- Research the internet how to get rid of old smartphones
- add PhD section about background for project I
- Call your brother to brainstorm about birthday ideas for your mom

These are more bite-sized and arguably cause less stress, as you don't have to think that much when doing them. You can just do them.


# Todos vs. Projects

When following the advice above of bite-sizing Todos into tasks, you will often identify actions that require multiple tasks to be completed. This is what I call a "project". That's right: Everything that takes more than one task is a project. By that definition, lots of things end up being a project. Certainly the big things like "Write your PhD thesis" or "refurbish your apartment". But also small things like "get Mom a birthday present" or "set up joint call with Joe, Marcus and Jenny". 

Why is it so important to have such a prolific definition of a "project"? Because any action that requires multiple tasks represents a "loose end" in your life, which is a source of stress if unattended. Whenever you're dealing with a project, you will - more often than not - have just completed the next bite-sized action, and then there is more thinking to do for that project for the next step. If you follow my advice on your ToDo-list, you do not keep a record for these things in your ToDo-list, because you don't want to clutter your ToDo-list with things that you can't actually do. So you need an extra concept for your loose ends. That's what a project list is for. You need some kind of list or system, where all your current projects live. 

At the time of this writing I have 56 open projects in my system, combining private, family and work life. Every single one of those would represent a source of stress if I had not written it down somewhere. Of course I can't work on all of these projects simultaneously. But it creates a sense of calm and control if you decide to work on one of your projects, that the other 55 projects are not lost, but safely wait in your system until you can attend to them again.
