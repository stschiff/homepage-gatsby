---

I’m excited to announce that there are now three talks from my group at the upcoming [EMBO | EMBL Symposium on Reconstructing the Human Past – Using Ancient and Modern Genomics](https://www.embo-embl-symposia.org/symposia/2019/EES19-02/speakers_organiser_gallery/index.html). My students Ke Wang and Joscha Gretzinger both have their abstracts accepted for a talk at the symposium. Congratulations!
