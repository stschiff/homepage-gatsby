Alongside our recent publication on [early medieval ancient DNA from England](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05247-2), we are honored to having been invited to be featured in a Special Issue of the magazine "Current Archaeology".

You can read all the wonderful articles of us and our colleagues online [here](https://the-past.com/magazines/current-archaeology-392/).

In particular, these articles cover a lot of archaeological details that could not be covered in our scientific article.

Update (January 2023): There is another article on this project in the magazine "British Archaeology", issue for Jan/Feb 2023. It's not available online, though.
